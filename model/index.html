<p>
Gestalta works in genres ranging from fashion through to art. She is currently available primarily for freelance projects where she has an interest in the themes, and prefers to collaborate with photographers and artists in the creative process. Her work often leans toward an exploration of her own psyche through erotic and surreal narratives, but she is also fascinated with the form and motion of the human body and the natural world.

She holds various LAMDA (London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art) certificates in speech, improvisation, and acting.
