    <p>
      Gestalta is a London based artist and model.  The main focus of her work is <a class="scroll-link" href="#shibari">shibari</a> (also known as kinbaku, or Japanese rope bondage) which forms the primary basis of her live performance and installation art. Much of her work stems from her interest in structure, movement and the human form, and a fascination with the links between eroticism, surrealism, and our often uncomfortable relationship with transience; all of which she frequently explores in her performance and rope work but also in her <a class="scroll-link" href="#photos">photography</a> and, often, in her work as a <a class="scroll-link" href="#photos">model</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a performance artist her work has been seen around Japan and Australia, and in many European cities including London, Paris, Berlin, Prague, Geneva, and Barcelona.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is the curator of <a href="http://soapboxshibari.com" target="_blank">The Soap Box</a>, a bi-monthly performance & art event which she co-organises in collaboration with <a href="http://anatomiestudio.com" target="_blank">Anatomie Studio</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      She frequently leads workshops about Shibari, including a monthly Introduction to Shibari open to complete beginners at <a href="http://anatomiestudio.com" target="_blank">Anatomie Studio</a>, London, and also teaches privately.

    </p>
    <p>
      Gestalta has been studying shibari since her introduction to it in 2007, and first began experimenting with it as a form of performance art in 2009.  Her initial interest was purely in the visuals of shibari, such as the seemingly organic structure of rope on the body, or the evocative photography of Nobyoshi Araki, but as she began to familiarise herself with the experience first hand she soon developed an appreciation for the psychological and erotic aspects of rope bondage, which lead her on a journey into the world of BDSM, first in the west, and eventually into the underground of Tokyo and Osaka.  Her relationship with shibari continues to fluctuate, often aggressively,  between the simultaneously complementary and contradictory aspects of the sexual and the artistic.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a performer her work is often direct and minimalistic with a focus on bold, dynamic transitions and movements, which she likes to contrast by presenting in a soft, subtle, and feminine way. More recently, she has been working on rope based installations.
    </p>
    <p>
      She absorbed much of her technical rigging style as a natural process of observation and experience during the 3 years she spent modelling for top Japanese nawashi, Kazami Ranki, but prefers to mix and evolve elements from different styles rather than to follow any ryu (style) religiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is available as a performance and installation artist - please contact with any enquiries.  More information on Private Tuition and Workshops, including dates and prices can be found here.
