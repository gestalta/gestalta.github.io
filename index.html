    <p>
      I was first introduced to shibari in 2007 and have been immersed in it ever since.<br>
      My interest was initially sparked by the aesthetic of shibari, seduced by the seemingly organic structure of rope melding with flesh, in contrast to the more industrial look of western BDSM. I was fascinated by the awkwardly evocative photography of Nobyoshi Araki, and other artists whose works I had collected in scraps from Japanese erotic publications.<br>
      As I began to familiarise myself with the experience first hand I soon developed an appreciation for the psychology and eroticism of rope bondage, which lead me on a journey into the world of BDSM.<br>
      Although I see shibari very much as an art form, it is also important to me that it’s bdsm/pornographic roots are not glossed over. For me, shibari is a powerful way of reconciling any perceived conflict between art and sex and exploring the relationship between the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      I first found shibari as a form of performance art around 2 years into my exploration of ropes.
      As a performer my work is often direct and minimalistic with a focus on bold, dynamic transitions and movements, which I like to contrast by presenting in a soft, and subtle way.

  <div class="splash-section-text">
    <p>
      My approach to shibari has evolved as the result of over a decade of practice on both sides of the ropes and a broad range of influences which I appropriate, mix and develop in my own practice. This has shaped my teaching style into one that seeks to reflect the experience of both tying partners on a deep level. I have a strong belief that shibari should not be prescriptive and encourage students to explore it as a flexible set of tools; adapting each tie to the body of the tied partner, and to their needs and desires within each individual situation. My teaching process aims to enable this by giving students a framework of the fundamental principles behind shibari; including safety efficiency and fluency, but also body awareness, communication, and conscious consideration of their own experiences and motivations.
    </p>
    <p>
      I absorbed most of my technical rigging style a natural process of observation and experience from inside the ropes of the people I was tied by as a model. In this respect I have been lucky to have had a broad range of influences: Kazami Ranki, who I modeled for from 2011 to 2014 and whose style still provides fundamental building blocks for my own style, Miumi-U who studied with the Ichinawa-Kai, and Esinem. More recent stylistic influences include Pedro (whose own style was heavily influenced by Kanna and Naka Akira), and Yukimura Haruki, whom I was very fortunate to meet in 2015.

      <h5 class="month-title">WORKSHOPS</h5>
    <p>
      I travel frequently to teach workshops; if you are an organiser / facilitator and you are interested in arranging something with me in your area please get in <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/#contact">contact</a> to discuss.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am happy to tailor workshops to suit the level and interests of your group.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to me that my workshops are held in an environment that promotes inclusivity and mutual respect between all participants; I do my best to reflect this personally where possible, and ask also that workshop facilitators/organisers and attendees have an open-minded and aware attitude.
    </p>
      <h5 class="month-title">PRIVATE SHIBARI TUITION</h5>
    <p>
      I am available to teach privately in any of the cities I am traveling to. Please see my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/#schedule">schedule</a> for information on where I will be, or <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/#contact">contact</a> me to find out when I might be coming to your area.
    </p>
    <p>
      Private lessons are available to students of all experience levels and are individually tailored to your needs. You can book regular lessons for a structured overview, or one-off lessons to learn particular things of interest to you with more attention to detail than can be found in a group environment. Please feel free to contact me to discuss your interests.
    <br>
      Although I don't teach 'bottoming skills' as a standalone subject, I am very happy to be booked for private sessions that are focussed on the model, helping both partners to develop together.
