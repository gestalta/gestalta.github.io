<p>
  I am available to give private shibari tuition suitable for all levels, from complete beginners through to more advanced riggers.  This is perfect for those that want to learn shibari but don’t have the flexibility to attend workshops, or simply want to learn in a more discreet environment.  Lessons are individually tailored to your needs, and you can book regular lessons to give you a structured overview, or book one-off lessons to learn particular things of interest to you with more attention to detail than can be found in a group environment. Please contact me to discuss your needs.  If you’re unsure where to start, take a look at the content of my workshops to give you an idea of the sort of things that I frequently teach.
</p>
<p>
  I aim to give all students a comprehensive grasp of the principals behind shibari, so that you come away knowing not just how to do things, but also why you’re doing them.  As a rigger who also modelled for many years, I am familiar with rope from both sides and teach in a way that reflects that, and I am happy to give advice from a models perspective whilst teaching from a riggers perspective.  I go into detail not just on how to form patterns with rope, but how to move your rope, yourself and your partner whilst tying.

<p>
  Private lessons are are ideal for:
</p>
<ul class="information-list">
  <li>– Beginners who want a structured approach to give a firm grasp of the basics of shibari.</li>
  <li>– More advanced riggers who are ready to move on to suspensions, or transitions in a focussed environment.</li>
  <li>– Riggers of all levels who want to go into more detail on the things they’ve already learnt.</li>
  <li>– Couples who want to learn in a private / discreet environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  In addition to individual lessons, I am also happy to teach small groups of 2 to 3 couples.
</p>
<h2 class="information-text-h2">Venues</h2>
<p>
  Most of my lessons are taught from either my home in South East London – a clean, warm, and modern environment, with high ceilings, suspension point, and a relaxed atmosphere, or Anatomie Studio in Peckham, a spacious and friendly dedicated rope studio with lots of suspension points, soft flooring, and great natural light – this is particularly good if you want to book private lessons for a small group of people.  Tea and coffee etc. are available at both venues!
</p>
<p>
  I am also very happy to discuss the possibility of travelling to other locations.
</p>
<h2 class="information-text-h2">Pricing</h2>
<p>
  I typically teach private lessons in sessions of 1 to 3 hours as I feel this is a good way to learn productively without getting overloaded with information. However, I’m happy to teach more intensive full days in two 3 hour sessions with a break for lunch in the middle, which might be more convenient for those travelling a longer distance for sessions!
</p>
<p>
  All prices below are based on lessons based at my home.  For lessons at Anatomie Studio there is an additional charge of £20 / for one hour sessions, and an additional £10 for every hour after.  For lessons at other locations, I may charge a travel fee if it’s outside of London.

<h2 class="information-text-h2"> Models / Partners</h2>
<p>
  You are very welcome to bring your own model, whether it is a partner or a friend to all lessons.  If you don’t have anyone to bring and you’d like me to arrange a model for you, then I’m very happy to do so.  Most models will charge a fee for their time, typically around £20 – £30 per hour, although this is at the discretion of the model.
