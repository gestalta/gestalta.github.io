Shot in Tokyo, Japan in May 2015 as part of Shuji Kobayashi's 'Showa' series; a collection of photographs set in Showa era Japan belonging to a fictional Japanese film director.
Found after his death by his wife, they presumably portray anonymous actresses.
Shibari enthusiasts might also be interested to know that the old style house that this series is shot in belongs to Naka Akira.
