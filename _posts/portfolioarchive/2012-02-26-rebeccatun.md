It’s an interesting point that ‘open leg’ has now become a genre in it’s own right rather than just a pose. With realism as a central feature of that genre in the mainstream (presumably to, paradoxically, facilitate fantasy) it has gained a reputation for being artless and vapid.

Pictures such as Panayiotis Lamprou's portrait 'My British Wife' challenge the idea that there are some parts of human anatomy that are intrinsically more presentable than others by portraying deliberate, intimate and knowing exposure in the context of art, but invariably cause a little controversy. This series was an experiment, to see if removing all realism from the scenario, and thus detaching the genre from it's context, could create an entirely uncontroversial image, and to see if it could be possible to see if, at least theoretically, 'open leg' could be rehabilitated.
