It’s interesting to observe that ‘open leg’ has become a genre in it’s own right rather than just a pose. With realism as a central feature of that genre in the mainstream (presumably to, paradoxically, facilitate fantasy) it has gained a reputation for being artless and vapid.

There are exceptions that prove the rule, pictures such as Panayiotis Lamprou's portrait 'My British Wife', which challenges the idea that there are some parts of human anatomy that are intrinsically more presentable than others by portraying realistic, intimate and knowing exposure in the context of art, but in doing so manages to loose the 'open leg' label.

This series was an experiment in the other direction, what does an 'open leg' image become when it is completely divorced from realism?
