It’s an interesting point that ‘open leg’ seems to have become a genre in it’s own right rather than just a pose. Realism is a central feature of that genre, perhaps in order to facilitate fantasy by making the subject convincingly 'obtainable'.

In removing all realism from the scenario, and thus removing the genre from it's context

Detachment
aloof posed
surreality
no part of the body is more or less presentable per s

What I want to say is that because no body part should be more or less presentable it should be possible to create non porn photos.
But I want to know... at what point does it become porn, is it purely contextual, or is it more than that, or less than that. the end

surreality
detached, posed, and perhaps even a little aloof.
on noticing deliberate intimate and knowing exposure
A bit like Panayiotis Lamprou’s Portrait 'My British Wife'
