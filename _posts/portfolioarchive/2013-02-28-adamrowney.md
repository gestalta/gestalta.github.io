The night before shooting these I dropped one of my pointe shoes into a cup of tea.  The stain can clearly be seen on the toe of the left shoe.  I almost photoshopped it out but then changed my mind, deciding to leave it there as a testament to my catastrophic clumsiness (particularly in the realm of hot beverages).

Shot in Cambridge, UK. February 2013
