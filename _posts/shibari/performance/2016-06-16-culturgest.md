These photos were not taken during the performance, rather during a 'dress' rehearsal the night before so that the sound of the camera didn't cause distraction. The next 2 nights took place in silence.

I was unprepared for how 3 repetitions of the same set of actions in the same space can produce such different reactions, both from the people on the stage and in the audience. It's rare, in shibari, that anyone has the chance to do this in such a controlled environment and I often hear riggers pronounce that in order to achieve 'authenticity' you must go onstage unrehearsed and never repeat the same show without at least some variation.

I've always been sceptical of this and for me this show has put the idea to rest forever. It was a technical and tough sequence of 23 transitions without repetition that Pedro had been working on for a long time, and together we'd been practicing it for 2 months. Performed in an art gallery space, it was decided that the show should be removed from the trappings of bdsm, and thus we removed any interaction or communication to create something that would have seemed clinical. But far from loosing authenticity, to me it seemed to draw it's authenticity from just this; the simple opportunity to objectively compare gave me a humbling awareness and appreciation of the space and the people around me, and also the smallest of internal changes.
