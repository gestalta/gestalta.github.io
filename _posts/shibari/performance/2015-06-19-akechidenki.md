Snapshots from a performance with Pedro at an event in Tokyo, organised by Nawashi Kanna to mark the 10th anniversary of the passing of Akechi Denki Sensei.

The event also included performances from Kanna & Kagura, a screening of one of the scenes from Pedro's film "<a href="http://www.jyowa.com/" target="_blank_">Jyowa</a>", and a public discussion session with Kanna, Naka Akira, Pedro, and others.
