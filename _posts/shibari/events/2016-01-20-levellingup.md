<h2 class="information-text-h2">‘LEVELLING UP’ SHIBARI COURSE DESCRIPTION</h2>

This shibari course is aimed at those who already have a little experience in tying, but are beginning to think about advancing further – possibly into suspensions or partial suspensions.

We’ll be going into detail on one style of 3 rope gote – breaking it down and examining each part of the structure, and thinking carefully about how to position and tension each part – with the end goal of every participant being able to tie a solid, suspension worthy harness.

In addition to this, I’ll be showing you a variety of commonly used ties, and explaining their uses both as ties in their own right and as great technical exercises for helping you to become fluent in tying with good tension on various different parts of the body including:

– variations on the futomomo<br>
– a hip harness and body harness<br>
– hishi patterns<br>
– hojo cuffs<br>

We will be looking at 2 simple but fun partial suspensions, which will give you things to practice in preparation for your first suspension, but are also a safe and enjoyable option for play in their own right.

Other elements included in the course:

– quick releases<br>
– hair ties<br>
– basic strappado positions<br>
– agura shibari<br>
