<h2 class="information-text-h2">21st - 23rd April 2017</h2>

Happy to be back teaching a second time in Oslo, Norway.<br>
My model for this weekend will be the wonderful Noctuelle, who will be on hand to share her experience from the inside of the rope and answer any questions from rope bottoms.

This workshop will be a mix of an intensive study of some of the fundamental elements of shibari, and ideas and inspiration for more playful bondage. Content will include an in depth look at the gote (aka TK, ushiro takate kote, box tie), excercises in line mangement, excercises in balance when working with static suspension, an introduction to working with transitions, and playing low to the floor with torture ties, hojo inspired ties, and partial suspensions.

To get the most out of this workshop partners are encouraged to work together with the model as an active participant, and much of the content will have a focus from both sides of the rope, including body management, nerve issues, and tips and tricks to help your body inside of the ropes.

<h2 class="information-text-h2">Student Prerequisites</h2>
**Riggers**<br>
Non collapsible single column tie<br>
3 rope gote (any style) that you can tie comfortably in under 10 minutes. (It is preferable that this has been taught to you in a class and reviewed by a teacher, rather than learnt purely from books/videos.)<br>
Experience with attaching and locking suspension lines efficiently.<br>
**Models**<br>
Some experience with being in a TK, and awareness of your body within it is useful, but not essential.<br>

Dates and times:<br>
Friday 21st : 1800 - 2200<br>
Saturday 22nd : 1200 - 2000<br>
Sunday 23rd : 1200 - 2000<br>
