I’ll be teaching a two day Introduction to Suspension workshop on 27th and 28th February 2016 at Anatomie Studio London!

The workshop is aimed at students who are already able to tie a standard 3 rope gote (aka TK, box tie, takate kote) and have some experience of tying on the floor, but want to start moving into the air in a safe and structured way.

I’ll be showing you all the fundamental elements that go into safe suspension – including building solid suspension harnesses, attaching and locking suspension lines, tying efficiently, communicating clearly with your partner and, of course, how to get down again afterwards.  I’ll also be explaining some of the different equipment you can use for suspension, and discussing some of the reasons behind why we do suspensions in the first place.

This suspension workshop is also a perfect opportunity to do your first suspension safely in a supervised environment.

To read the course description in full please take a look here.

The tickets, priced at £125 per couple, will be released in January and details will be posted here – if you’re interested in coming, then <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/#contact">contact me</a> and I’ll update you when it arrives!

And if you don’t quite feel that you’re ready for suspension then I’ll also be running a 4 week shibari course starting on 20th January for those that want to ‘level up’.
