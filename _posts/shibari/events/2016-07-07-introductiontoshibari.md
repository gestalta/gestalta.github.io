**Introduction to Shibari** is a full day workshop that I taught monthly in London from August 2015, to November 2016. In 2017, this will take on an exciting new life, so watch this space!

These classes are suitable for those who are curious about shibari and would like to learn all the fundamental basics of this practice in a safe, inclusive and body-positive environment.  I teach in a way that demonstrates the reasons behind what you’re tying – giving you the tools to not only follow the patterns that I make, but to work out how to make your own.

**ANY QUESTIONS?** Feel free to contact me!

<h2 class="information-text-h2">Introduction to Shibari - Workshop Description</h2>

The introduction to shibari workshop is aimed at complete beginners, who have little to no experience with shibari.  It aims to give a comprehensive overview of the basics, whilst also explaining the reasons and principles behind the things I’m teaching.  I aim to give you an introduction to some of the most fundamental knots and frictions used in shibari, help you to choose a good tension to tie with, and begin thinking about the importance of ‘flow’ when tying as I believe that working on this right from the beginning of your bondage journey will help you to progress later on.

I will explain some of the most common safety concerns within bondage, and how to communicate about this effectively with your partner.

For those that are interested, I’ll talk a little about the origins of shibari in Japan, and it’s development through to it’s present day form – and will explain a bit about the differences between types of rope and which to choose.

The ties in this course are chosen both because it’s important to learn these ties in themselves, but also because they’re great tools for explaining the principles of bondage, rather than just learning to copy and follow a pattern by rote.

The ties we’ll focus on are:
<ul class="information-list">
<li> – single column tie (and variations)</li>
<li> – creating ‘ladders’</li>
<li> – 3 of the most commonly used frictions in shibari</li>
<li> – futomomos</li>
<li> – hojo wraps</li>
<li> – cinches</li>
<li> – Simplified 2 rope Gote (also known as ‘box tie’, TK or takate kote)</li>
</ul>
I will also demonstrate different ways of putting together the elements covered during the workshop to create other useful ties.
