I am available to give private shibari lessons to students of all levels of experience. Please feel free to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/#contact">contact me</a> to discuss your needs and interests.

As someone who has extensive experience as both a rigger and a shibari model, I try to teach in a way that reflects both sides of the rope and I am happy to be booked for private sessions that focus in on particular issues for the model, helping partners to work through things together.

*am available to give private shibari tuition for people of all levels, from complete beginners through to more advanced riggers. This is perfect for those that want to learn shibari but don’t have the flexibility to attend workshops, or simply want to learn in a more discreet environment. Lessons are individually tailored to your needs, and you can book regular lessons to give you a structured overview, or book one-off lessons to learn particular things of interest to you with more attention to detail than can be found in a group environment. Please feel free to contact me to discuss your needs and interests.*

<b>Small Groups (2-3 couples)</b> = €30 per couple per hour<br>


<h2 class="information-text-h3">Location</h2>

Private sessions can usually be taught from my home in Birkenstraße, Berlin.

I am also available to teach privately in any of the cities I am traveling to. Please see my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/#schedule">schedule</a> for information on where I will be; you can also sign up for my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/#contact">newsletter</a> to be kept informed.

<h2 class="information-text-h3">Models / Partners</h2>

You are very welcome to bring your own model, whether it is a partner or a friend to all lessons.  If you don’t have anyone to bring and you’d like me to arrange a model for you I’m happy to do so. Most models will charge a fee for their time, typically around €10 - €15 per hour (although this amount is at the individual discretion of the model).
