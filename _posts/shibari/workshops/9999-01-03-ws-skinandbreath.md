**“Skin & Breath – On The Border with Gestalta"**

*"Gestalta’s handling of the physical body can be described as “minimally invasive.” At the same time however her bondage practice has a deep and profound affect on the bodies that she ties. In this workshop we will be developing in the fields of subtle manipulation, breath work, and breathlessness in addition to more precise, goal-oriented, and refined ropework."* ~ Kristina Marlen


Skin revolves like a sensitive and protective suit around our bodies. Skin divides the inner from the outer world. Skin protects and makes us vulnerable at the same time. Skin is breathing, literally.

Manipulation via skin needs a certain subtlty. Its not the big movements and impacts, that we need if we try to enter a partner via Skin. The more clear and intentional the ropework, the deeper the resonance.

I invited Gestalta because I would call her style, in opposition to mine for example, as „Minimally invasive“. Her physical closeness is rather non- intrusive; in the meantime, her ropework is tremendeously intense and challenging for her rope partners.

In this workshop we´ll explore the potential of intimacy, specific to Gestaltas Ropework.

The mornings start with a bodywork class led by Kristina Marlen to embody the topics skin and breath.

The workshop will cover the following topics:

<li>setting a space / atmosphere between you and your partner using rhythm, pace, and breath.</li>
<li>working with positions and shapes that create particular sensations</li>
<li>effecting or controlling the breathing through challenging positions or restrictive ties</li>
<li>Body movement and rope techniques for keeping a non-intrusive flow to your tying</li>
<li>keeping your tying in flow whilst using transition sequences for building up and prolonging the experience</li>
<br>
Gestalta is a shibari teacher and performer, originally from the UK but currently based in Berlin. Her approach to shibari has evolved as the result of over a decade of practice on both sides of the ropes and a broad range of influences which she appropriates, mixes and develops in her own practice.
This has shaped her teaching style into one that seeks to reflect the experience of both tying partners on a deep level. She has a strong belief that shibari should not be prescriptive and encourages students to explore it as a flexible set of tools; adapting each tie to the body of the tied partner, and to their needs and desires within each individual situation.
Her teaching process aims to enable this by giving students a framework of the fundamental principles behind shibari; including safety, efficiency and fluency, but also body awareness, communication, and conscious consideration of their own experiences and motivations.
