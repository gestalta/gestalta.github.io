The workshop is aimed at intermediate to advanced riggers and will cover various different types of strappado, and a variety of uses for it.

WHAT IS STRAPPADO?

IMG_0467In the west, it has it’s roots in a form of medieval torture. There is no official term for it in Japan, although it is used by the Japanese and I have heard it described as both “sakate” (simply ‘reverse hands’) or “kagerou” (‘mayfly’).  In this workshop I will teach you a variety of different versions, from the relatively comfortable, to the more torturous.  I will show you how to use this versatile tie for floor based semenawa play and how to use it to safely suspend.

The content of this workshop is useful from a play perspective, but also has some useful technical challenges for those that want to learn more about some of the trickier aspects of tensioning rope in relation to their partner’s flexibility.

PROGRAM:
– shoulder warm up
– a demonstration of variations on the strappado tie
– floor ties for semenawa using the strappado
– safely suspending using the strappado
(practical exercises will vary depending on the level of the class)
MINIMUM REQUIRED SKILLS:
– Single Column Ties
– Experience with either full or partial suspension (safe locking of suspension lines)
– Although we will not be using one in this class, understanding a standard gote (TK / box tie) and the frictions used in it will be useful for other ties.
