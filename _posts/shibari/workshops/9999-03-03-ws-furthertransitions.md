***N.B. Variations of this workshop can be taught over 1 or 2 full days.***

This workshop is aimed at people who are already confident with transitions but want to improve their technique. We will explore elements such as balance, gravity, and torsion to help participants think outside the box.  Many of the ties demonstrated in the workshop will be performance based, but will still include many elements for improving everyoneâ€™s technical understanding, regardless of whether or not they are interested in performing.

At various points the class may also touch on subjects such as communication, and strategies for quick thinking in an emergency situation. To get the most out of this workshop partners are encouraged to work together, with the model as an active participant, and we will also discuss tips and tricks for models to manage their bodies within the ropes.
