This is one of my favourite ties for play, particularly when tying with new people.

In this workshop I will show you several different ways to tie a yoko-tsuri, from the simple, to the more complex, and from dynamic, to more restrictive forms.

Minimum requirements:
– single column tie
– 3 rope gote
– ability to attach suspension lines safely
