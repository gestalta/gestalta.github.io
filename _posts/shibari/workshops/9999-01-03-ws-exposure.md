**This workshop will next be taught in Berlin on January 20th and 21st**

This workshop will explore sexual voyeurism and exhibitionism in rope play, in this case with a focus more specifically on exposure.
Looking and being looked at is for many a fundamental element of kinbaku. But what looking means - what emotions and dynamics arise from the act is highly dependent on intention, context, choice of tie and progression of the session. Using sexual exposure as a focus in a scene has the potential to turn looking and being looked at into an act that can cause intense and ambivalent feelings to arise. Arousal, shame, validation, hyper awareness and vulnerability are some of the things one might go through while experiencing exposure. From the topâ€™s perspective receiving the permission to expose someone and witness these reactions can be a powerful experience.

Participants will be encouraged to consider their own motivations behind exploring this type of play, both as tops and bottoms, and to discuss the feelings that arise for them throughout.
Students will be guided through a variety of different ties, positions and techniques that they can use to explore the different aspects of this theme.
There will also be a focus on using these ideas to build play scenarios within the workshop, and therefore we encourage you to attend with a partner that you feel comfortable with, as some aspects may be intense or intimate.

####TEACHERS

The sessions will be lead by Gestalta and/or Tamandua.
