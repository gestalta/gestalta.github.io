<h2 class="information-text-h2">Introduction to Shibari - Free Online Tutorial Series!</h2>

This video course has been a long time in the making, and I'm very happy to finally be able to share the result with you! It started it's life as a workshop that I had the pleasure of teaching in London every month from August 2015 to November 2016. During that time, the content and structure evolved gradually into the form that you’ll see here. Right from the beginning, I wrote the structure of this workshop with the intention of presenting a comprehensive overview of some of the fundamentals of shibari together in a way that made sense within a larger context, rather than just as standalone elements, hoping to help people to get a firm grasp of the basics, but also to give them the ingredients to tie creatively right from the beginning.

KEY: IN DEPTH!!

This structure had a lot of incredibly positive feedback from attendees and it was wonderful to watch how fast many people were able to understand the basic principles of rope. Yet I felt that there were some flaws to teaching shibari at such an early stage in the context of a one day group workshop and as a result I started making plans in the summer of last year to turn this course into something that could be available online, originally with the plan of making short 'reminder' videos available to workshop attendees, but as I started writing out the content in more detail it became apparent that it made far more sense. The speed at which people learn can vary wildly at beginner level, leaving some students feeling like they’re falling behind whilst others find the pace far too slow. Additionally, a single day is an incredibly short amount of time to absorb such a lot of new information, especially when, in the case of shibari, much of it is information which needs to be committed to muscle memory and not just to the brain.  I started thinking very early on that it would be useful to create short videos that I could send to attendees to to remind them of certain elements of the workshop, but I eventually decided that it would be better still to make the entire content of the course available for people to work through at their own pace, and refer back to as often as they wished!<br>
I still think that having a real life, in the flesh teacher is essential for improving your shibari work and guiding you through the areas you need to improve in, and this video series is in not meant to replace that, rather it’s meant to give an initial foundation that you can ask a teacher for feedback on when you feel ready to do so.<br>
The videos in this series are intended to follow on from each other, but it’s also possible to just dip in and out of them to find the relevant information. Each video in this series is broken down into sections so that you get an overview of the topic, and then a bit more detail on various elements contained within it.  For example, the technical reasons behind it, how to change your approach in different situations, and also the flow and handling with which you apply the rope which is something that I feel needs to be taught right from the very beginning in order to avoid learning in bad habits that you’ll have to unlearn at a later date. (expand on this once I’ve finished writing the rest of the content!)<br>
Above all, it’s important to remember that learning shibari takes patience and practice.  It’s not something that you can expect to master overnight.<br>

Also… the information in this video is not how I do it myself, but I feel like it’s important to understand before you find better ways

I give my opinion at times… there is room for more than one opinion in rope - I don’t say with certainty that I won’t change my opinion.<br>

<h2 class="information-text-h2">Introduction to Shibari - Workshop Description</h2>

The introduction to shibari workshop is aimed at complete beginners, who have little to no experience with shibari.  It aims to give a comprehensive overview of the basics, whilst also explaining the reasons and principles behind the things I’m teaching.  I aim to give you an introduction to some of the most fundamental knots and frictions used in shibari, help you to choose a good tension to tie with, and begin thinking about the importance of ‘flow’ when tying as I believe that working on this right from the beginning of your bondage journey will help you to progress later on.

I will explain some of the most common safety concerns within bondage, and how to communicate about this effectively with your partner.

For those that are interested, I’ll talk a little about the origins of shibari in Japan, and it’s development through to it’s present day form – and will explain a bit about the differences between types of rope and which to choose.

The ties in this course are chosen both because it’s important to learn these ties in themselves, but also because they’re great tools for explaining the principles of bondage, rather than just learning to copy and follow a pattern by rote.

The ties we’ll focus on are:
<ul class="information-list">
<li> – single column tie (and variations)</li>
<li> – creating ‘ladders’</li>
<li> – 3 of the most commonly used frictions in shibari</li>
<li> – futomomos</li>
<li> – hojo wraps</li>
<li> – cinches</li>
<li> – Simplified 2 rope Gote (also known as ‘box tie’, TK or takate kote)</li>
</ul>
I will also demonstrate different ways of putting together the elements covered during the workshop to create other useful ties.
