This is a regular class aimed at beginners which will run 3 Monday evenings per month on the following dates in Südstern, Berlin.  

**October** : 2nd, 9th, 16th<br>
**November** : 6th, 13th, 20th<br>
**December** : 4th, 11th, 18th<br>

The classes aim to give a structured approach to learning ropes whilst keeping each week as a 'standalone' class, meaning that students don't have to worry about falling behind if they can't attend every week.  Regular attendance will help to build up a foundational knowledge that will help you to move onto more advanced ropework, and with this in mind, you can attend as many classes as you feel are useful to you.

It is not necessary to have a partner to attend classes with. Students attending alone can partner with each other to practice the ties, both as a rigger and as a model.
