<h3 class="information-text-h3">EVENT DESCRIPTION AND PROGRAMME</h3>

*The minimum requirement for this workshop is the ability to tie a suspension worthy solid stem, 3 rope gote (aka box tie, takate kote, TK) of any style comfortably in under 10 minutes. This should preferably have been taught to you in a workshop or private lesson If you are unsure etc.*

*Gestalta will begin the class by reviewing everyone’s gote individually to make sure that it’s suspension ready, and making suggestions for improvement if needed individually. She will also explain what to look for in judging whether or not a harness is suspension worthy.*

Gestalta will then discuss some of the reasons behind why we do suspension, the different styles and ways to use it, and the feeling of suspension from the perspective of both the rigger and the model.
