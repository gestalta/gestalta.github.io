***N.B. This workshop can be taught over 1 or 2 full days.***

Transitions (moving the tied body from one position to another) can open up a whole new range of possibilities in rope suspension. Although often viewed as something overly complex and 'performative', transitioning can can also be a useful tool within play scenarios, and for many people a form of play in it's own right.

The process of moving from basic static suspension to more dynamic work can sometimes be daunting, and therefore this class is designed to give students a solid foundation for performing the most basic transitions safely.

We will use a range of straightforward exercises to help you practice essential techniques such as line management, lifting and lowering, and beginning to understand body mechanics - eventually building these exercises up into a simple transition sequence. The class will also consider subjects such as communication, and strategies for quick thinking in an emergency situation. To get the most out of this workshop partners are encouraged to work together, with the model as an active participant, and we will also discuss tips and tricks for models to manage their bodies within the ropes.

Exact exercises will vary depending on the level of the class. We may also review various harnesses with a focus on choosing a suitable structure for transitions.

####WORKSHOP OBJECTIVES

<li>Understand fundamental techniques needed for safe movement in the air.</li>
<li>Develop physical awareness and techniques to protect the bodies of both rigger and model when performing transitions.</li>
<li>Consider body mechanics; the range and limitations of movement of the human body.</li>
<li>Effective communication between partners during transitions.</li>
