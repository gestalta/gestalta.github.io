This workshop is for students who are already able to perform a basic suspension, but want to move on to some more dynamic work.

I will be showing you a sequence of the most straightforward (and also, in my opinion, some of the safest and most fun!) transitions in bondage, all of which can be performed using a standard gote, and hip harness; both of which I will review during the class and offer advice on how to improve it if necessary.

I will show you how to move the model’s body smoothly between the positions, and how to address any issues you might come accross in the process.

I will also be talking a bit about how to communicate clearly with your partner, how to avoid getting into ‘panic’ situations, and how to play and have fun in the ropes :)

Minimum requirements<br>
– 3 Rope Gote<br>
– Hip Harness<br>
– Single column tie<br>
