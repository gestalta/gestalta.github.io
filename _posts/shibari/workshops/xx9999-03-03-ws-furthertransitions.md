<h2 class="information-text-h2">Further transitions 1 - Understanding Torsion</h2>
<h2 class="information-text-h2">Further transitions 2 - Understandng Balance</h2>

We will work with a range of straightforward transitions to help you practice essential techniques, such as line management, lifting and lowering techniques, and beginning to understand body mechanics and movement.<br>
At various points the class may also touch on subjects such as communication, and strategies for quick thinking in an emergency situation. To get the most out of this workshop partners are encouraged to work together, with the model as an active participant, and we will also discuss tips and tricks for models to manage their bodies within the ropes.

Exact exercises will vary depending on the level of the class. We may also review the gote and the hip harness with a focus on choosing a suitable structure for transitions.

**Workshop objectives**
<li>Understanding of fundamental techniques needed for safe movement in the air.</li>
<li>Body awareness; protecting the bodies of both rigger and model when performing transitions</li>
<li>To consider body mechanics; the range and limitations of movement of the human body</li>
<li></li>
<br>
**Student Prerequisites**<br>
<br>
***Riggers:***<br>
>> Non collapsible single column tie<br>
>> 3 rope gote (any style) that you can tie comfortably in under 10 minutes. *(It is preferable that this has been taught to you in a class and reviewed by a teacher, rather than learnt purely from books/videos.)*<br>
>> Experience with attaching and locking suspension lines efficiently.<br>
>> Experience with hip harnesses is useful, but not essential<br>
***Models:***<br>
>> Experience with being in suspension.<br>
<br>
**Materials Needed**: 10 ropes of 7.5-8m in length, plus a few short pieces. Suspension equipment (e.g. ring, carabiners, rigger plate etc.). It is advisable that, no matter what youâ€™re working with as your hardpoint, you have at least 2 carabiners spare.
