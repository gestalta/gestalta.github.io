The Gote (aka ushiro takate kote, TK, or box tie) is one of the most widely used and fundamental ties in shibari. It’s common for many riggers begin their rope journey by learning one particular type/style of gote ‘by rote’, but there are countless variations on the pattern and as you progress it’s useful to have an awareness of these different structures to enable you to ‘problem solve’ in different situations, adapt to the body of your model, and evolve on your own by learning to think critically about your own tying.
To get the most out of this workshop partners are encouraged to work together, with the model as an active participant.

<h3 class="information-text-h3">Workshop Objectives</h3>
-§- Encourage both partners to increase body awareness - including nerves, body positioning, and exercises to condition and protect the body pre and post rope.<br>
-§- Break down each passage of the tie to understand the function of each individual element, and compare various methods from different gote structures.<br>
-§- Learn how to rebuild the tie in a way that’s right for your model, and for the situation you’re in, with increased awareness to help you self assess the safety and suitability of your tie.<br>
<br>
<h3 class="information-text-h3">Student Prerequisites</h3>

-§- Non collapsible single column tie<br>

*(It is preferable that this has been taught to you in a class and reviewed by a teacher, rather than learnt purely from books/videos.)*<br>
<br>
Models:<br>
-§- Some experience with being in a TK, and awareness of your body within it is useful, but not essential.<br>
<br>
