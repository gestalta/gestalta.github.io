### Event description and programme

The minimum requirement for this workshop is the ability to tie a 3 rope gote (also known as box tie, takate kote, or TK) of any style.

Gestalta will begin the class by reviewing everyone’s gote individually to make sure that it’s suspension ready, and making suggestions for improvement if needed individually. She will also explain what to look for in judging whether or not a harness is suspendable.

Gestalta will then discuss some of the reasons behind why we do suspension, the different styles and ways to use it, and the feeling of suspension from the perspective of both the rigger and the model.

She will also explain some of the most important elements in safe suspension, and will gradually build these into a basic yoko-zuri (side suspension).
