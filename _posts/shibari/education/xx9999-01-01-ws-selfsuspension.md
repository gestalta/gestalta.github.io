This workshop is meant as an introduction to self suspension, however it is also suitable for people who may have a little bit of experience already and are just looking for some more inspiration.  The style of self suspension that I practice personally is quite performance orientated and is based around movement fluidly whilst in rope, rather than suspending in static positions. I will be explaining some of the ways I do this and some ways you can experiment with this on your own.

I will be teaching you the hip harness that I use in detail, and how to attach suspension lines safely (both whilst on the ground and in the air). I’ll show you some of the positions that I frequently use and how to move fluently between them.

The technical elements this workshop will cover are:

– Attaching and locking suspension lines safely and efficiently
– Hip harnesses for self suspension
– A range of single column ties useful for self suspension
