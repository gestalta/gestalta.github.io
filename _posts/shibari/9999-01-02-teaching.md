My approach to shibari has evolved as the result of over a decade of practice on both sides of the ropes and a broad range of influences which I appropriate, mix and develop in my own practice. This has shaped my teaching style into one that seeks to reflect the experience of both tying partners on a deep level. I have a strong belief that shibari should not be prescriptive and encourage students to explore it as a flexible set of tools; adapting each tie to the body of the tied partner, and to their needs and desires within each individual situation. My teaching process aims to enable this by giving students a framework of the fundamental principles behind shibari; including safety efficiency and fluency, but also body awareness, communication, and conscious consideration of their own experiences and motivations.

It is important to me that my workshops are held in an environment that promotes inclusivity and mutual respect between all participants; I do my best to reflect this personally where possible, and ask also that workshop facilitators/organisers and attendees have an open-minded and aware attitude.

####TYING STYLE  
My personal tying style has been described as technical, precise, rhythmic, steady. I have a strong focus on dynamic transitions, smooth movements, steady pace, non intrusive tying style.

####BACKGROUND  
I absorbed most of my technical rigging style a natural process of observation and experience from inside the ropes of the people I was tied by as a model. In this respect I have been lucky to have had a broad range of influences: Kazami Ranki, who I modeled for from 2011 to 2014 and whose style still forms the fundamental building blocks of my own style, and Miumi-U who studied with the Ichinawa-Kai, more recent influences include Pedro (whose own unique style was most heavily influenced by Kanna and Naka Akira) and Yukimura Haruki, whom I was very fortunate to meet in 2015.

I travel frequently to teach workshops; if you are an organiser/facilitator and you are interested in arranging something with me in your area please <a href="{{baseurl}}/#contact">get in contact</a>.  The workshops listed here are

Even if I don’t have a date planned right now, if there’s enough interest in a topic it might prompt me to arrange something! Most of these shibari workshops can also be tailored to private lessons.

An explanation of the curriculum.<br>
Beginner level<br>
Introduction to shibari is divided into 2 main parts - part 1 is standalone - part 2 has part 1 as a prerequisite.<br>
Hojojutsu is a standalone workshop which requires very little experience however it can be taught to students of any level.<br>
All workshops in the 'Beginner/intermediate' section are based around preparing students for suspension - building stable, suspendible harnesses, and focussing in on details such as line management and whatnot.<br>
the 'Intermediate / Advanced' workshops all presuppose that the students are already confident with basic suspensions.<br>

Most of these workshops can be altered slightly according to the level of the students, whilst still conveying the basic principles, however
