This workshop is based around one of the most fundamental ties in shibari, the Gote (also known as takate kote, TK, or box tie). There are countless variations on this tie, but probably no such thing as the ‘perfect’ Gote. Rather than just give you a set pattern to follow I aim to give you a knowledge of the elements that make a good Gote work well, and choose the right one for the right situation…

In this I will:<br>
– compare the structure and functionality of several different types of Gote<br>
– break down the elements of the Gote step by step, to understand the features necessary for suspension and safety, and the common difficulties hidden within this tie.

Through this we will also cover:<br>
– how to choose the right tension for your tie depending on the situation<br>
– the position of your model’s body in the Gote<br>
– wrap positioning for avoiding damage / injury<br>
– the importance of the frictions you use in the Gote<br>
– looking after your models! As in every nearly every workshop I teach, I will include some basic techniques to help relieve tension in your model’s shoulders caused by being in a gote.

Minimum Requirements:<br>
– single / double column tie.<br>
– ability to tie a basic Gote (2 or 3 rope)
