The Gote (aka takate kote, TK, or box tie) is one of the most fundamental ties in shibari. Many riggers begin their rope journey by learning one type of gote “by rote”, but there are countless variations on the pattern, and no real need to stick to just one.
This class will look at several different types of three rope gote including a variation on the Kazami-ryu gote, variations on the kinoko / kanna / osada style gotes and variations on more minimal styles.

Gestalta will break down these gotes into several different elements, show you variations on each, and explain the functions with the aim of helping you to begin thinking about what makes a good gote work well and how to choose the right one for each situation.

**Workshop objectives:**
<li>compare the structure and functionality of different types of Gote</li>
<li>break down the different passages of the Gote step by step to understand the features necessary for suspension and safety and explore the common difficulties hidden within this tie</li>
<li>think about how to choose the 'right' gote for the situation</li>
<br>
**Through this we will also cover:**
<li>how to choose a good tension for your tie (depending on the situation)</li>
<li>the position of your model’s body in the Gote</li>
<li>wrap positioning</li>
<li>the importance of the frictions you use in the Gote</li>
<li>looking after your models; some basic techniques to help relieve tension specific to being in a gote in your model’s shoulders.</li>
<br>
**Minimum Requirements:**
<li>single / double column tie.</li>
<li>ability to tie a basic Gote (2 or 3 rope) taught to you in a workshop or private tuition</li>
