The hishi gote is a functional and versatile variation on the ‘regular’ gote, characterised by a diamond (‘hishi’) pattern at the front. It is both visually beautiful and has a great flow to the tying pattern.
This workshop aims to teach one basic pattern of hishi gote, and address common issues in tensioning ropes when tying in this style. I will also cover many of the basic points on wrap placement, body positioning and frictions common to all gotes.
