      I teach a range shibari workshops for students of all levels.  I aim to make my workshops fun and relaxed, whilst still going into lots of detail.  I try to give all students as much individual attention as possible within the workshop, and am happy for students to take photos and videos to help them remember the content.

      I am resident teacher at Anatomie Studio, London, and many of my workshops are taught there, however I do also travel to teach in other areas.  A helpful outline of some of the shibari workshops I currently offer is listed below.  If you are an organiser and are interested in arranging something in your area this should give you an idea of the sort of thing I have to offer. If you’re a student interested in attending one of these workshops then contact me to find out when and where I’ll next be teaching it.  Even if I don’t have a date planned right now, if there’s enough interest in a topic it might prompt me to arrange something!  Most of these shibari workshops can also be tailored to private lessons.

      This is meant a guideline, and is by no means an exhaustive list, and I am frequently adding to, updating, and changing my work.

      Most of these workshops can be altered slightly according to the level of the students, whilst still conveying the basic principles, however they all presuppose that the students are already able to do basic suspensions.<br>
